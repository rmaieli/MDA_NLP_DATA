I always struggle to figure out which brand is best but chose Bosch since I’ve had good experiences with their other blades.  Oddly enough, my two blades had to be fulfilled from 2 different Amazon sources since they are two different sizes which caused one blade to come a day earlier than the other.  So, when the driver-side blade arrived, I figured I’d install it and get a great side-by-side comparison with my old passenger-side blade.  The difference was amazing!!  We had a terrific downpour and the ICON blade was far superior to my old Rain-X blade.  Yes, the old blade had been on a while but still seemed in good physical shape.  The next day, I installed the other ICON blade when it arrived and, again, I couldn’t be happier with the blades.  They definitely appear to be well worth the extra few bucks.  BTW, install was very easy (instructions included); each blade took just a minute to replace.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R3QTN9ZTZWYUTC

VERY IMPRESSIVE!!,"I know I have only owned this vacuum for about an hour, I have to say it is by far the best vacuum I've ever purchased and I have gone through a few of vacuums in my life time.
First of all don't worry about putting this vacuum together because it was very simple and took less than 5 minutes to figure out (my 6yr old lego building addict even helped).
Now as far as suction.... this vacuum really sucks and it's rare when you say that it's a positive thing. I tested this compact power house of a vac on wood floors, door mat carpets, and thick rugs and in every case it was scary good. In fact it was so good I was shocked and kinda grossed out how much dirt, animal hair, etc it picked up. Yikes!! I thought I had a pretty good vacuum before but this Shark put my last vacuum to shame. This vac was even did a great job picking up the dirt that gets trapped in the crevices of my hard wood floors which i use to have to break out my shop vac to do a good job getting. It is great on stairs as well!! The brush is strong and because it's so compact versus my old vac, I could easily use it wherever.
Now I have only used this one day but so far... I'm floored at how powerful it is.
For now I give it a 10 (5 stars). I'll let you know how I feel in about 3 months.
If your in need for a great vac for a reasonable price... grab it!",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R3DG682T18XCHS

Good price, easy to install, work great.
UPDATE....
Changed review from 5 star to ONE...
After a few rain storms, the wiper no longer clears the windshield.  Instead, it leaves areas of ""streaks"".
When you're driving in an Alaskan snowstorm with below 0 temps and the defroster going full bore..... you don't want your wiper leaving streaks of defrosted ice and snow on the windshield.  I'd be bad enough already.... don't need a streaky windshield.
The reviews were very impressive, but for me, and the weather that's coming, I can't take the chance on additional wiper failure..  They are very easy to install.  And, come in a great package....as if that means anything.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R1OJ0GXUMP5JSQ

I live in southern California and it doesn't rain here much, so it's easy for wipers to dry out. My previous pair had gotten so bad that I would rather not turn them on because they always made things worse! I guess since it doesn't rain much and maybe I'm a little lazy and too cheap to buy new wipers so I just kept applying rain-x and not using them, but finally I decided enough was enough. The difference is incredible. While a bit more expensive than some other wipers, it's worth it, especially if it lasts as long as they say.

Installation was the easiest I've ever had.  They simply slide right into place.  The best though by far is the non streaking coverage of the blade.  I've been buying blades for over 20 years and nothing has came close to these icon blades.  They've handled the super icy conditions we have here in Michigan with ease.  These last few weeks we've had thrown freezing rain, snow, road mud, ice at them and I still get a clear windshield every time they run.  I use them with RainX washer fluid and all my visual problems driving went away with the combination of these products.
I read some of the negative reviews and what some people need to understand is some defects of any products happen when they are mass produced.  Contact the company and resolve the problem with them.  They are a good company and stand by their products.  There is also a warranty.  As to their longevity they were put to the test because of our harsh weather.  My last set lasted 5 years.  Need I say more?
They've worked so well that I put a second set and installed them on my wife's Jeep.  I feel better that she will have better visibility driving with our daughter in the car.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R2N73173DTSNG1

The only wipers I use on my cars.,"I have used the Bosch Icons on all of my cars since they hit the market years ago.  Like a lot of people.  I have been through many different brands and types of wipers, but I find that these Icons give me the overall performance I am looking for.  I change the windshield wipers on my cars every year at the end of the summer, because I live in the central valley, ca where summers are in the triple digits and the air is fairly dry.  So summers take a toll on the wipers rubber.  I have never had any problems with Bosch Icons.  Every pair that I have purchased have been great and performed well.  I stick with these because they just have a lot of attributes that other wipers do not have.  These wipers are frameless so they hug the contour of the windshield instead of just sitting on top of the windshield which can leave lines of water on the windshield.  They perform very well at high speeds.  With some wipers aerodynamics wasn't taken into account, so what happens is at high speeds the wipers begin to lift ever so slightly away from the windshield loosing their ability to remove all the water from the windshield efficiently.  With the design of these Bosch Icons though.  They are pushed into the windshield at high speeds so you dont loose performance.  These also do not cause any wind noise at high speeds.  The sleek design of these just looks great.  Most importantly these wipers just do a fantastic job at moving every dropping of water off of the windshield.  I recommend picking these up and some of the RainX Washer Fluid additive.  The additive makes the water bead up on the windows and makes it easier for the wipers to completely remove it.  The Icons work great with out it, but the additive just make them that much better",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R88SEDZPP0T8G

These blades (proper model number) fit and performed excellently on my Lexus RX350, 2007.  However, despite buying the proper model (as checked by phone with Bosch), they did not perform well on my Infiniti G20, 1999.  In one direction, they cleaned the windshield; in the other, they left a curve of water.  I checked this out with my car repair guy.  He agrees that, although Bosch wiper blades generally give excellent performance, some models do not have adequate give/flexibility on some windshields.  He put on another Bosch model, not as highly rated, that did the trick.  So, before buying advise carefully picking through the reviews to confirm that, beyond a specific model for your car, that it actually provides a good performance when placed on the car.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R2PMSA8059ALBV

Had for only three weeks on, and used heavy for week now in WA rain, and they work very well. Tried the latitude blades twice, and not happy. You won't go wrong with these blades. Will update after a few months of use. UPDATE 11/26/16. Well, I would give 0 stars now. Used a total of three weeks in WA rain then working in CA till two weeks ago where I didn't have to use at all. They are very streaky with multiple lines on the windshield. I cleaned the windshield and the wiper blades thoroughly to make sure they weren't dry or cracked.

Literal side-by side performance test / comparison:
I'm returning to these Bosch Icons again after putting a pair of these on the driver side over a year ago. At that time, I had an extra cheaper, Anco brand wiper blade that I put on the passenger side at the exact same time — The Anco lasted less than half the time of the Bosch Icon, and was much more prone, even when newer, to streak, squawk and jutter over the glass. The Bosch Icons were just noticeably better — especially in light, intermittent rain, and they really shined over the Ancos in the winter with snow and ice.
These are more expensive, but last longer and have noticeably better performance. I find that these also respond well to reconditioning if you clean them well with alcohol periodically.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R3UH26KXH41MOK

So we're left to visit the local auto parts store for something we can put our eyes on, to ensure that we get the right thing.
After so many years of e-commerce, it is disappointing to see that there is still such a strong ""wing and a prayer"" element to online fulfillment - we rely here on a 2D barcode sticker slapped on the back of the package, by someone who evidently could not be bothered to look at the front.

Flawless on even that light drizzle/moisture/mist that seems to leave droplets behind with many blades. I have a 2007 Outlander which called for ""A"" type on the driver's side, which is standard and ""B"" type on the passenger's side as sometimes called for. By mistake I ordered two ""A"" type blades. I was just about to return the passenger's side for a ""B"" type as indicated but I decided to try the ""A"" anyway. Installed and worked great.

Good wipers are one of those things.  The “experts” are now suggesting we change our wipers every six months.  (I wonder if they have stock in a wiper company?)  Of course so many other factors go in to the mix including whether you keep your car in the garage to how much your wipers are actually used.  Purchasing wipers has become as complicated as decided what athletic shoe to buy?  Do you want them to run, walk, sit, bike?  Why do we allow things to get this complicated?  That being said, if you are here you are doing the right thing.  You are conducting a little research to hopefully obtain the best wiper for the best price.  The first thing I will share is, as I’m sure you already know, there are plenty of blades out there for a lot less money.  Let’s talk about the price difference.  Assuming this is one of the best on the market, and the lowest price blade is one of the worst, we are looking at three times the cost.  The truth is 21” wiper blades can be easily found for $5 or $6 each.  Why then did I pay $17?  Bosch has found a way to distribute the same pressure throughout the entire blade while it clears away snow and/or water.  This is important.  I understand the “rubber” they use is actually a “blend” which keeps the operation silent, longer.  They also advertise their blades come without hinges and brackets.  Quite possibly this could equate to less things to “break”.  It should be noted this is advertised as an “all weather condition” wiper.  This may be “overkill” for some, or a really, really good wiper for others.  I reside in Southern New Jersey where we can get a little snow from time to time.  I wanted a wiper to work like a squeegee and remove all water with a swipe.  It should be noted, that is exactly what happens with both the driver side and passenger side.  With one swipe ALL water is removed.  No streaks, no lines, no funny stuff.  Bosch claims their wipers can last up to 40% longer.  I’m not sure what that means.  Longer than what, the cheapest blade?  I have no doubt, from the feel and the look, these blades will last longer than some other blades.  I do know I was rather surprised during the first rain event.  They were remarkable.  Will they last?  I hope so?  Will they continue to perform?  I hope so.  Are they worth the money?  In my humble opinion they are very, very good wipers.  However, $17. is still a little high for a piece of rubber on a stick.  So for that reason I have chosen to rate this item at 4 stars.  Should the price come down a bit and these wipers perform well for a period of time, I will purchase them and rate them 5 stars next time.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R14NQFLOR56ESU

Also they cleaned my windshield and left a huge streak down the middle exactly where i needed to see the road.  But they are a year old now so they lasted pretty good amount of time.

Even if they had lasted 1 year, I would have been happy, as I usually have to replace wiper blades 1-2X/year.  These wipers were subjected to 3 years in Houston and 1.5 in NJ, and survived 100 degree plus weather, drought (they didn't succumb to dry rot)and, conversely, Houston's notorious rainy weather when the drought finally ended, as well as the blizzard of 2010 that dumped 4' of snow in the Philly area.
If this pair lasts as long, they may outlive the car (2002 Saab 9-3). I can't believe I'll get another 4 years out of a pair of wiper blades, but the good solid grip of these on the windshield at all speeds will guarantee clear vision in the worst weather, regardless of how long they last.

Keep in mind, there are different grades of wipers in the Bosch ""bracket-less"" line. Worse, there's a WalMart-specific line which sucks the big one. The Bosch ICONs are the top-of-the-line, and really do a fantastic job.
Fitment was perfect, no issues whatsoever getting them on the wiper arms of my 2001 Audi A4. This is in stark contrast to the Anco wipers I used previously, which were a nightmare to put on due to the latching mechanism. Once installed, the first wipe was breathtaking. No chatter whatsoever, just a perfect, silent glide across the windshield. The wipers get the windshield as clear as if I'd washed it by hand.
I've got a couple months on these so far, and they've held up perfectly. These were brutal Spring months with lots of slush, rain and dust. Still no chatter, and the wipe is still perfect. With luck, I'll be able to last through Winter with these blades. So even if they do cost a bit more than other brands, they actually save me money in the long run.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R2LXQZODINWRJD

(I know, because Amazon just reminded me of my prior order as I checked out the product page to order another set.) Only now are they starting to show signs of aging. Before these, I had wipers from Rain-X (two different kinds) and while they cost about 75% as much, they lasted 30% of the time. You do the math.
In case you're not familiar with them, Bosch is the company that actually makes the OEM wiper blades for many high end cars (like BMW, for one). In fact, you'd probably be surprised by how much inside your car is made by Bosch. So, you're not buying from a company that is just marketing cheap parts made in China and selling it with a lot of marketing. You're getting OEM quality with these, if not better. So, when considered in that light, as well, these blades really aren't that expensive.
They don't streak or chatter, and even after having them on my car for over a year, they are only streaking a small amount. That's saying something, as these have now made it through two Boston winters.
So, the blades really do last, but will you be happy with them while they do? I think so. They hold the shape of the windshield well, and never flap or vibrate, no matter how fast you're going. The bracket is solid, and worked well on the J-hook in my car. Many other ""universal"" mounts didn't work so well, notably the ones from the aforementioned Rain-X wipers. The single piece design is also great for those living in cold climates, as it is less vulnerable to ice and snow build-up.
Given that your eyes are the most important safety device on your car, you owe it to yourself to not skimp on wiper blades. But I'm pleased to report that despite the upfront cost, these are actually MORE cost effective than many other premium wiper blades, given that they are the only expensive wiper blades I've ever used that actually lasted longer than the cheap ones.
Tip: the A or the B after the model number (e.g. 22A) refers to the spring force of the blade (i.e. how hard it is to pull it straight). The B applies more force, and would be useful if you have a highly curved windshield. The fact that Bosch offers not just a variety of lengths down the inch, but also two different spring forces, is another indicator of the fact that these are not your average wiper blades. I found that having an A on the driver side and a B on the passenger side works best on my car. If in doubt, just try A all around, and then if you find that the blade is missing spots on the ends of the blade, return the A and get a B.
Last tip: Amazon's database is helpful, but by no means complete. If you think this will fit your car, but Amazon says it won't, ignore Amazon. They say neither blade I have on my car will work, and yet I'm extremely happy with them, as you can tell.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R341Q8T0ZR5DX4

I had Rainx ones on my car (Maxda 3) but could not see out of the driver's side when it rained. Recently driving home from my mother's on a long interstate road and not being able to see much of anything while it down poured, I knew I needed new wipers.
I saw the raving reviews for Bosch and owning other products of theirs, I knew they were quality. I did not want to wait so I went to my local shopping store hoping to get a pair. I found Bosch and figured they would all be about the same. I came home and the one I bought from the store had a terrible diagram and I could not get it installed for the life of me. I even had this stranger who offered to help me that saw I was struggling and he could not get it on my car. I then noticed it had a crack on the side. This is still the Bosch one but locally bought. I went to Bosch's website and notice the wiper was not even in their inventory, it must have been old.
I then came online and placed my order fearful it would not fit. The selling point for me was the video Mr.Erb placed up showing how easy it was to install. The store bought one had parts and whatnot, this one literally snaps in place. As odd as it might sound, I opted to only buy the driver's side. That was the side I could not see out of and wanted to compare them. I installed the blade in seconds, it was so simple! Now the test was, when the rain came in.
When it rained I was so exited to try the new wiper. Appearance wise, the Bosch just looks cool. Not a reason to buy it but it is nice that it sits low and is attractive. I was shocked at how well it cleaned the windshield when it rained! I am used to missing spots but the Bosch hugged my windshield and wiped all of the rain away. I looked over at what was still my good wiper, the Rainx one and it could not compare. It was missing spots and also was loud.
I knew Bosch made quality products but did not know they made such great wipers. I have since ordered one for the passenger side and will continue to buy these. I am very impressed with how well they work!",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,RE0JMDO4X5TQ6

I have had a go with a couple of them out such as Rain X and Anco, I am happy to say that the Bosch ICON wipers are THE BEST IN THE MARKET that I have ever tried. They were so easy to install since they have no brackets or hinges. The 21A fits my 2004 Dudge Durango passenger's side.
The wiper sits on the windshield snugly providing a uniform sweep when in use. I live in Western New York, so the weather out here is very unpredictable. In the winters I could be in a zero visible snow storm to sleeting rain in a mater of seconds. The Bosch ICON was able to handle those conditions without any issues. My windshield comes out so clean the glass actually looks invisible. It does not matter what speed you are going, these wipers will keep your windshield perfectly clear without streaks or squeaks.

Erb,AGEIFV5YGZDGWJONQVPYGYRSKSRA,Excellent long lasting blades. Resist snow and ice buildup. Easy to install,"UPDATE: These blades have lasted over a year and were great through the winter. Would buy these again.
The Bosch Icon 21A wiper blade was easily installed onto my Honda CRV.
My last blade was the AutoTex ""PINK"" - Black Bracketless Premium Wiper Blade - 21"", Pack of 1 which has been on my car since the end of August, 2010. So it's been on the car for about 18 months. Basic blades normally only last me 6-8 months before they begin streaking. So I was very happy with my previous wiper blades since they lasted about a year and a half.
The Bosch Icon wiper is very similar in appearance and construction as the AutoTex Pink blade. It installed very easily and since there is no exposed metal, ice and snow does not clog up the blade or stick to the framing hardly at all. It does give me superior performance in my climate than more conventional blades.
The only thing I can't comment on right now is how long these will last, but I will certainly update my review as time goes on. If they last as long as the AutoTex Pink, I'll be very happy. Heck, I'm already happy.",Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R1XTL4Y0ZVQFNF

Some left feedback that they didn't last long.  Mine lasted almost two years.  That might be because I used RainX a lot and don't used my wipers if not necessary...  Just bought my second pair.,Yes,,Not Deleted,,,R860IAXM2ZP6L
